• The allow_origins list defines which domains can send requests to your API.
 • allow_methods defines which HTTP methods are allowed from the client.
 • allow_headers ensures that the client can send custom headers if needed.

  You may also need to configure additional security headers in your FastAPI app to
 ensure a high level of security. This can include setting up headers like Content
 Security Policy (CSP), Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), and X-Frame
Options. These headers help mitigate attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and
 Clickjacking.
 While FastAPI doesn’t provide built-in middleware for all of these headers, you can use
 the Starlette framework or third-party libraries to configure them as needed.

 Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client. OAuth2 is
 a popular standard for authorization, which allows third-party applications to access
 resources on behalf of a user.
 FastAPI supports OAuth2 and can integrate seamlessly with tools such as JWT
 (JSON Web Tokens) to implement token-based authentication.

  5.2.0.3 Protecting Sensitive Data
 When dealing with sensitive data, it’s essential to adopt measures to ensure its
 confidentiality, integrity, and availability. FastAPI offers several strategies to protect
 sensitive data both during transmission and storage.
 1. Use HTTPS
 Always use HTTPS instead of HTTP for secure communication. HTTPS
 encrypts data during transmission, protecting it from man-in-the-middle (MITM)
 attacks.
 In production, configure your web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or FastAPI’s ASGI
 server (Uvicorn) to serve your application over HTTPS.
 2. Hashing Passwords
 Never store passwords in plaintext. Always hash passwords using a strong
 algorithm such as bcrypt. FastAPI integrates well with the Passlib library,
 which supports various hashing algorithms. In the example above, passwords are
 hashed using bcrypt before storage.
 3. Encrypt Sensitive Data
 For extra security, you can encrypt sensitive data stored in databases, ensuring
 that it remains safe even if the database is compromised. Use libraries like
 cryptography to implement encryption and decryption.
 4. Use Environment Variables
 Store sensitive configuration data, such as secret keys and database credentials,
 in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your application. Use
 libraries like python-dotenv to load environment variables from .env files in
 development.

 Conclusion
 In this section, we covered essential security practices for FastAPI applications:
 1. Handling CORS and security policies: We explored how to enable and
 configure CORS to allow cross-origin requests while maintaining security, as well
 as how to set additional HTTP security headers.
 2. Authentication with OAuth2: We demonstrated how to implement OAuth2
 authentication using JWT tokens, protecting API routes by validating tokens and
 issuing them upon successful login.
 3. Protecting sensitive data: We discussed strategies for protecting sensitive
 data, such as using HTTPS, hashing passwords, encrypting data, and using
 environment variables for storing secret information
